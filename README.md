Convolutuib
Matrix convolution is a mathematical operation that is commonly used in signal processing and image recognition. It involves multiplying a small matrix, called a kernel or filter, with a larger input matrix or image to produce an output matrix or feature map.

The kernel is typically a small square matrix with odd dimensions (e.g. 3x3 or 5x5), and it is centered on each pixel of the input matrix in turn. At each pixel, the kernel is multiplied element-wise with the corresponding sub-matrix of the input matrix. The resulting values are then summed to produce a single value for that pixel in the output matrix.
